Hello World! Thanks for tuning in to check out my 100 Days of Code log. This journey will not be pretty. For some it may be too much. My sanity will be put to the test, but should I prevail, I stand to become one of the most accomplished versions of myself. If I miss a day, don't judge. We all fall down sometimes.

I've been learning to code since February 2019 using self-directed tutorials like freeCodeCamp and now, The Odin Project. While I'm still a #CodeNewbie, I feel we can all learn from one another during our process. I hope you'll find this helpful and motivational for your own journey. Stay tuned for more!

To all my lovelies,
**Asha**

### Day 1: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics and navigation of the Command Line using The Odin Project and Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I struggled with whether this is considered coding or not then shrugged it off because at lease I was finally starting. I was super excited to finally start The Odin Project as I had been saying I would do it for months. Even though I didn't start where I thought I would, I was proud of myself for pushing through. The Command Line tasks were kind of confusing at first which is why the Codecademy lessons were extremely helpful! I don't think I would have made it through day one without them.



### Day 2:  September 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Coded my Github Log page to make it more visually enjoyable as suggested by Joe Warren (link to article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-transform-your-100daysofcode-log-into-a-visual-experience-d048334af8d9/).

**Thoughts**:  This was something I felt I needed to do for myself because I like to have somewhat of a structure in place when completing projects. I mean who doesn't take time in some form or fashion to make themselves look good. Taking the time to change up the structure of my log is my form of primping. I constantly committed then edited this post within an inch of its life. If Github keeps track of how many times one post is edited, I'd say it'd have to be over 100 times. I even cut out my photo (above) and added a background color in Photoshop, for the first time I might add ðŸ˜Š. I enjoyed knowing that all of this would help me further down the line and it also still counted as an hour of coding! #FTW



### Day 3:  September 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Coded my first Rails app! and pushed it to Github and Heroku from the Command Line ðŸ˜Ž

**Thoughts**:  This one was pretty rough even though I was following a tutorial. I accidentally closed the window after installing Rails, BUT couldn't reinstall it because it already existing. Admittedly, I was a little distracted and was not paying 100% attention like I should have been. So, I went through and deleted everything I downloaded and started over with complete focus and I did it! It was nice just forgetting about everything else running through my head and watching the code loading after running the next steps. This took me at least 3 hours to do, but it's awesome and it's done.



### Day 4:  September 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Continued learning Git commands in the Command Line

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A-zJuR8FWkheM359aEJmZ2GjeFkR0bFi3X3jXaZ9chxQsWmXSgVY584mDV4wkZOGUkdpx4nnqikepOm82051yuoUMu0_x9d9UbZv-8KXCtWOmApHmazX6AaZT-YmRNt82qlfr4ekq4mJngiPDH4fSqt65AAdkNy3mm005PEbsmQ-IPv7mHAuAapUNH-uU5C8gJ99LnI9IuFLZNpyN-c4BrKcZfVDuqBKWtfLwFHw5P9NhocWX0pG8OX9In8mYGBzGeZyLIzdwwVnKl9YIHzV4vKVIeXy7QxKX0elZgbXAbXUaby3cPgTezWoTQXM72PAPHEIfdyBZX89HXvSR4Neiy8TpAUqyAHsDeurNGbATM5h9HRVy6sUYXrseYd8px20GsaL-3ksJ0-FgLWGg5BUh7vfMt-rJY1yc2c8Op13FGNpzPxA8jtuFvidChlEBLNDtJRZ8b0fReqBK552-U3V78eesC8uzTsLnMh095JhWaMid6uEAHExYXEANNgvnrwsU05hYkzBj26IRXbs9wgqaHrd_kiRDgHChbokoFP4xwRQutf0Em8beSU02bXoUee9jSbXPcd9CCrn0tDReZf3si6eAMblp8wJ8-MsGNdad_NI0GNx1RgwbEoTn2Mm4Pyt7slSZsApfAF-jiATs4IKfXj7aMsZRpRDeJ0MXFTMr7XvS4EGsMrxGtc=w1678-h891-no" alt="Screenshot of Command Line Git code">

**Thoughts**:  I was pretty distracted today. It was difficult to pay attention to every detail of this task as I have just finished a final project for my class and Git can be pretty confusing. I was able to stick with it and learned the basic Git commands that are used during workflow. That was pretty satisfying, but it was definitely one of those days where it wasn't the most exciting thing I've done so far. Now I'm just trying to figure out why none of my photos are showing up in my log. Bit of a bummer, but I'm tired. I'll fix the pics tomorrow after my brain recharges.
